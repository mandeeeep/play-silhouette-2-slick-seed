Silhouette 2 Slick Seed Template
=====================================

Its a seed template for Silhouette 2 using Slick. The examples provided in [Silhouette Examples](http://silhouette.mohiva.com/v2.0/docs/examples) had the required examples but there weren't any ready template making use of Silhouette 2 + Slick. So, mixed and matched these repos:

* https://github.com/mohiva/play-silhouette-seed
* https://github.com/sne11ius/play-silhouette-slick-seed

The Silhouette Seed project is an Activator template which shows how [Silhouette](https://github.com/mohiva/play-silhouette) can be implemented in a Play Framework application. It's a starting point which can be extended to fit your needs.
